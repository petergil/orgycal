#+TITLE: orgycal

import ics calendars to org files.

Currently this fulfills my minimal use-case but needs to be fixed to
be generally useful.

Usage: ~orgycal [-in infile] [-out outfile]~

Where ~infile~ is an ics file and ~outfile~ is the name of the file to
write to. Note that ~outfile~ will be overwritten!

* TODO Things to fix

  - better flag handling
  - error handling
  - test cases
  - nicer way to filter extra info
  - extract more metadata and map to org constructs
  - represent org document as a data structure and not using
    string-based handling (maybe look at [[https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org][go-org]])
